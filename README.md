## 🧪 Testing the Workflow

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5678/webhook/add-watch   -H "Content-Type: application/json"   -d '{
    "org_id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
    "title": "Sony WH-1000XM5",
    "brand": "Sony",

## 🧠 Optional AI Enhancements

Add a node after `FN: Eval Alerts`:

**OpenAI Node Prompt Example:**
> Check if this price drop is significant (more than 15% compared to last 30 days). Only alert if meaningful.

---

## 🧩 Extending the System

| Feature | How to Add |
|----------|-------------|
| Competitor price tracking | Create a 2nd cron workflow for delta comparison |
| Repricing engine | Add Python/AI node to compute new recommended prices |
| Dashboard | Connect Postgres to Grafana or Metabase |
| Multi-channel alerts | Duplicate Slack/Email nodes for SMS, Discord, etc. |

---

## 💡 Tips

- Use rotating proxies for anti-bot protection on retailers.
- Use n8n environment variables for credentials (`{{ $env.DB_PASS }}`).
- Run in Docker for 24/7 uptime.
